# Code-Healer

This is a simple Flask web application with two HTML files, `index.html` and `layout.html`, and an `app.py` Python file. The application serves as a starting point for building web applications with Flask.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Flask: You can install it using pip: `pip install flask`.

## Getting Started
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
Run the Flask application:
python app.py
The application will start and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

Project Structure
app.py: This is the main Python file that defines the Flask application and routes.
templates/: This directory contains the HTML templates.
index.html: The main HTML file for the application.
layout.html: A layout template that can be reused in other pages.

Customization
You can customize this web app by editing the index.html, layout.html, and app.py files to add your own content and functionality.

Deployment
To deploy your Flask web app to a production server, you can use services like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting platform of your choice. Be sure to configure your server environment according to the hosting provider's instructions.
